# üå¨Ô∏è Airflow DAGs Playground

This repository is a growing collection of Apache Airflow DAGs ‚Äî each designed to explore unique data engineering workflows, from API ingestion and transformation to metadata tracking and orchestration.

## üîç What You'll Find

- A variety of DAGs, each solving different real-world data challenges
- Modular and reusable ETL patterns using Python and SQL
- Integrations with tools like PostgreSQL, REST APIs, and OpenMetadata
- Reverse-engineered workflows to explore best practices and edge cases

## ‚ú® Sample Pipelines

- `vehicleDB_pipeline`: Tracks latest vehicle models by year/type from API to PostgreSQL
- `pharma_dag_airflow`: Ingests and transforms pharmaceutical data for structured storage
- `uk_air_pollution_pipeline`: Reconstructs air quality datasets from public sources

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Apache Airflow 2.x
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL
